My second game project "Organiser".

On webpage you can create Themes, add plans (and their cost if required), add your savings.
If your savings quantity exceeds plan cost it will be highlighted.
Accomplishing plans reduces your savings by given cost amount.
Every element can be deleted.
All information is restored on reload via ajax.

Things to improve:
1. –êdaptability (At the given moment works correctly only on pc and big tablets).
2. Fix highlighting (occasionally doesnt work).
3. Add scroll bars.
4. SPA anchors.
5. More customisation options.
6. More interaction with keyboard ( esc and enter binding).
7. Expand validation.
